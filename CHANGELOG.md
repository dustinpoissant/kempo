# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]
### Added
- **Marketplace marks.** An extension from the marketplace can be marked official (a green verified icon) or featured (a green workspace-premium icon). The icon sits before the name on the extension browse cards and on its details page.
- **Browse cards have a gap** between them.

### Fixed
- **Installing a downloaded extension** whose requirements were not installed failed with "Requires … to be installed and enabled first". The Install button now shows the same list of extensions to install and enable as installing from the marketplace, and installs them all once approved.

## [4.9.7] - 2026-10-25
### Changed
- **Requires kempo-ui 0.7.0.** Admin lists use the kempo-ui `Table` component with its built-in paging, selection and row controls, instead of hand-written tables.
- **Groups, group members, a user's groups, users, fragments, global content, pages, templates and extensions** are tables. A row opens its record, and the edit and open actions are row controls (`kc-tc-open`). The list of pages and templates keeps its one flexible column (name or description), so it takes the spare width.
- **Emails log** is a table with paging. Opening an email is a row control that shows it in the same dialog as before.
- **Email templates** are a table. Preview opens in a new tab, and Edit opens the editor dialog.
- **Updates** is a table with selection. Each row has its own update button, and the bottom control updates every ticked row. Extensions that need a newer Kempo are still only updated together with the Kempo update that provides them.
- **Extension list**: "View in Store" is a row control that opens the marketplace page.

### Removed
- The `admin-extension-details` row control (`tableControls/ExtensionDetails.js`). The extensions list uses `kc-tc-open` with the same destination.

### Kept
- `admin-table-row-link` (`components/TableRowLink.js`) is still served, because extensions that have not moved to `_url` rows still load it.

### Fixed
- The users table no longer scales its fixed-width columns when the Name column has no explicit size. Name takes the spare width.
